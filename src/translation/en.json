  "patogh-des": "Patogh is a cultural-artistic group run by former and current Iranian students in Munich. After about 8 years of continuous activity, we registered this group in 2018 as a non-profit, non-political and non-religious association in Munich’s municipality. Patogh tries to provide a platform for dialogue on culture and art, and helping and advising students in Munich.",
  "festival-des": "The powerful contemporary music scene of Iran remains unknown today not only for the international audience but also for people of the Iranian diaspora. The genres of experimental and electronic music, though influenced by traditional Iranian music, stand far from the cliché perception of “oriental” art. The volatile and yet paradoxical life in Iran has brought a wave of experimental and electronic artists who reflect both the melancholia of an abnormal life and the creativity inherited with it to the stage. Noise, beats, and the occasional presence of Iranian modal music in the pieces reflect a rooted urban life current in a curious or even paradoxical amalgam of the traditional and the modern lives of this generation. As the real being of youth life in Iran is mostly reflected in these waves presenting the noblest reading of culture, we set the mission of our project to provide an independent platform for the artists of this realm. This realm holds inseparable characteristics of urban art within which is common in the similar genres of European backgrounds. Therefore, we see this as an opportunity for popular understanding, cultural encounters, and exchange. In this regard, we would like to hold a musical festival of contemporary music in December wherein the first place the four Iranian artists bands (three residing in Europe and one in Iran) will perform on stage with Munich artists in these genres. The aim is to bridge the social gap between migrant and host societies and form a common memory for them towards the city. The final night of the festival holds on 21.12. when the traditional Iranian festival of the longest night of the year (Yalda night) is celebrated. This festival is the time for family reunions and festive quality time in Iran which is missing for many diaspora Iranians. That is why Patogh e.V. has been constantly and regularly holding this festival with artistic creativity (see the link) for the last 6 years. It is believed that Christmas and Yalda Night have the same root, or at least a connection, as both invite us to persist in hope in the darkness. These similarities and connections offer the opportunity to provide a more modern reading of this tradition and use it as the second pylon of the bridge to the rooted culture of Christmas and to shape an intercultural celebration specifically for the city of Munich.",

  "embryo-des": "The band \"Embryo\" is cult. For 52 years, the formation has not been stopped by genre boundaries, mixing jazz, world music, rock, psychedelic and much more. In 2015, multi-instrumentalist Marja Burchard, daughter of co-founder Christian Burchard, took over the reins of the legendary band and led them into new territory with as much skill as curiosity. \nWhen Embryo was born in 1969, free spirit reigned, experimentation was done to one's heart's content, everything was allowed. The colorful troupe continued to develop because they were always bringing guests and thus new influences onto the stage and into the studio. They made music with Mal Waldron, Trilok Gurtu, Okay Temiz, Rabih Abou-Khalil, Jury Parfenov and many others. What the musicians from Munich did commanded great respect even from Miles Davis.\nMarja Burchard (rhodes, organ, tb, santur, vibes), Maasl Maier (e-b, sax, perc, umlaute), Sascha Lüer (sax, tp), Wolfi Schlick (sax, flute), Sebastian Wolfgruber (dr, perc, brake drum)",
  "persian-des": "Sam Khatam, known as Persian Empire, is a young German musician born to Iranian parents. He released his first electronic album in 2012, gently fusing the oddities of sounds and eerie vocal samples. On top of that, he chops his own voice into it, creating a blend of organic electronic beats. Nothing happens twice, one scene always evolves into the next. Nevertheless, his music sounds very complex, it is really composed of simple layers, as he also says: \"It could start with a crunchy clap sound, a vocal idea or with my piano compositions\".\nAfter a few years of piano lessons, the producer picked up the instrument again and has since released many single tracks and albums.\nSometimes he uses samples of Iranian pop music from the 50s and 60s when he needs some spices to make them sound sophisticated. This unique combination of soulful synth sounds and highly sophisticated drum grooves puts him right on the map of emerging electronic artists.",
  "roya-des": "Roya Arab, UK based Iranian archaeologist (IoA, UCL), cultural curator (Associate Member, LMEI and CIS, SOAS) and musician first appeared on Londinium as a member of Archive in 1996, since then she has collaborated with various artists such as Grooverider, Zend Avesta, Leila and more recently Rone.

  "the-seem": "The SEEM",
  "seem-des": "The word \"Seem\" in Farsi generally means wire. However, due to the ambivalent nature of the Persian language, it also means cable and string.\nBecause of this multifaceted definition of this simple word, it is present in many aspects of life. As a cable, it appears as an indispensable part of any urban landscape; as a string, it acts as the main carrier of sound in instruments; and finally, as a wire, it is the main supplier of all electronic gadgets.\nAll these said, we may be skipping over thinking about \"seem\" in our everyday lives, as well as every sound and noise and unconventional sound in urban life.\nThe focus of this project is to bring these sounds to life and compose them under experimental, instrumental and electro-technical music, where \"Seem\" plays a crucial role.\nIn short, our festival is a call to respect the experimental sound around us, and in this sense it is the celebration of cable, string and wire at the same time. That is, it is the celebration of \"Seem.\"\nTo this end, we have named our project \"Seem|Festival\".",
